# Area of Interest 

I am interested in the phenomenology of emotions. I focus on questions of ontological opacity and ambiguity, as given in both subjective and intersubjective emotional experiences. My work in this area has focused on wonder, melancholia (depression), and guilt, but I also am interested in other emotions such as anger, resentment, and the like in interpersonal contexts. With that, I am interested in the limits of phenomenological methods, primarily drawing from Merleau-Ponty, Heidegger, and Husserl. Alongside this, I am interested in psychoanalysis, namely Freud.
